				<p><b>The floating guava market</b> is a traditional floating market in Barishal. It is not mandatory to travel abroad to have the thrilling experience of visiting a floating market. The floating guava market is located at Bhimruli, about 15 km distant from the southernmost district town of Jhalokati in Bangladesh. It appears as the centre of Barisal’s (aka The Venice of Bengal) beauty. Nobody knows when the idea of this floating market began, but it’s a hundred-year old tradition. This floating market sits at the confluence of three canals. The market is dominated by the largest guava orchards in Asia bordering Jhalokati, Barishal, and Pirojpur. For their livelihood, about 20,000 families in 26 villages under Jhalokati, Barishal, and Pirojpur districts depend on this guava orchard spread on 31,000 acres of land. </p>
