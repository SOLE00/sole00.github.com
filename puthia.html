				<p><b>The Puthia Temple Complex</b> consists of a cluster of notable old Hindu temples in Puthia Upazila, Rajshahi District, Bangladesh.It has the largest number of historic temples in Bangladesh. The temples were built by Hindu Zamindars Rajas of the Puthia Raj family who were noted philanthropists of Rajshahi. The temples have been built in terracotta in a variety of styles combining the typical Jor-bangla architecture with other influences. The Rajbari or Palace of the Raja of Puthia and the Dol Mancha are part of the complex. The temples are laid out around a lake with a sprawling lawn. </p>
				
				<br><b><u>Location :</u></b><br> Puthia Temple Complex is located 23 km to the east of Rajshahi city.   <br>

				<br><b><u>Directions :</u></b><br>
				<b>From Rajshahi-</b>You can catch a bus from Rajshahi to Puthia and Natore from the Station Road at Bhandra bus stop.There will be plenty of buses (of course all in Bangla), but people will be going out of their way to help you and point at the right bus.It takes roughly 40 minutes to reach Puthia by bus and you need to pay to the driver 30 Taka. The bus will drop you at Puthia Bus Stand. From there you can take a shared e-plank (if I may call it so) for 10 Taka till the Temple Complex.
