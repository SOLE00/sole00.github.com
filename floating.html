				<p><b>The floating guava market</b>, located at Barishal, about 15 km distant from the southernmost district town of Jhalokati in Bangladesh, is a traditional floating market of Bangladesh. This market sits at the confluence of three canals. It is dominated by the largest guava orchards in Asia bordering Jhalokati, Barishal, and Pirojpur. For their livelihood, about 20,000 families in 26 villages under Jhalokati, Barishal, and Pirojpur districts depend on this guava orchard spread on 31,000 acres of land. The floating market appears as the centre of Barisal’s (aka The Venice of Bengal) beauty. Nobody knows when the idea of this floating market began, but it’s a hundred-year old tradition. Everyday, hundreds of boats are loaded with guava. The sellers look for the buyer in the canals. Here most of the buyers are the wholesaler. They come to market with big engine boats, buy guava from small boats and take it in Dhaka city as well as other big cities. </p>
				
				<br><b><u>Location and Season:</u></b><br>The floating market is located in Bhimruli of Jhalokati district, the southern part of Bangladesh. The Bazar sits in the small canals of the village Vimruli, which is about 15 kilometers away from the Jhalokathi town, runs from morning to evening every day. Though the Bazar sits throughout the year, in the season of Guava, it gets the life. Although the peak season of Guava is July and August, there are several markets that continue to sell till September.<br>

				<br><b><u>Suggested Restaurants and Foods:</u></b><br>
				When you have completed watching Floating Market of Vimrul, go to Kureana Bazar. You will find a hotel named Sokal Shonda. Locally, it is also known as “Boudir Hotel.” If you are in a small group of 6-7 people, you will get sufficient foods here. But if you go with a large group of up to 20 members, then it is better to talk before to get the foods. At the hotel, you will get fresh fish with deshi rice. It’s very amazing.<br>
