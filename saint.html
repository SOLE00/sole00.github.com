				<p><b>St. Martin's Island</b> is a small island (area only 3 km2) in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal. It is generally known as “Narikel Zinzira” in Bengali, which means 'Coconut Island’ and this is the only coral reef island in Bangladesh. There is aslo a small adjoining island that is separated at high tide, called Chera Dwip. It is about 8 kilometres (5 miles) west of the northwest coast of Myanmar, at the mouth of the Naf River. Geographically, St. Martin's Island is divided into three parts. The northern part is called Narikel Jinjira or Uttarpara. The southern part is known as Dakshinpara. A narrow central belt or Maddhyapara connects the two parts. Overall, the island is a very pleasant place that can easily refresh anyone's soul. </p>
				
				<br><b><u>Location:</u></b><br> The island is about 9 km south of the tip of the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf peninsula, and forms the southernmost part of Bangladesh.<br>

				<b><u>Directions :</u></b><br>
				<b>From Chittagong-</b>
				Getting to Saint Martins Island is a two-step process. First you'll need to travel to Teknaf which is the Southern most district of Bangladesh on the very southern tip, sandwiched up against Myanmar. One can come to Teknaf by bus. Chittagong to Teknaf bus fare is around BDT 400-600 non-A/C and BDT 800-1200 A/C. <br>
				From Teknaf you can cruise to St Martin's Island with the safest ship Keari Sindbad and reach St Martin's comfortably in 2 or fewer hours. Ferries leave for the island around 9 am. You can purchase a round trip ticket. Prices are same whenever you return. The return fare on Keari Sindbad start from BDT 550-800.<br>

				<br><b><u>Accommodations and costs:</u></b> There are several budget guesthouses along the main road such as Hotel Sea Heart, Bay of Bengal Guesthouse, Coast Guesthouse, Hotel Sadek, Oceanview and Coral Reef Guesthouse. Anywhere else these rooms would cost around Tk 500-700, but here you'll be lucky to pay Tk 1000 and be asked for as much as Tk 1500.<br>

				<br><b><u>Suggested Foods: </u></b>The islanders dried fish, which is a bit more expensive but fresher than those available upshore in Cox's Bazaar. You can often bring it to your hotel chef and ask him to fry it up the way you like, or some places may do a nice evening barbeque. Some places may even give you kitchen access to cook it yourself if you ask.<br>
